Problem Statement:
You’re working on a smart contract deployed on a blockchain using Solidity.
Your task is to implement a function that returns the index of the nearest
larger number to a given index `i` within an array of integers.
The catch? The distance is measured in array indices. Here’s the problem statement in more detail:

Input:

An array of integers stored on the blockchain.
An index `i` within the array (0-based index).

Output:

The index of the nearest larger number to the number at index `i`. If two or more larger numbers are equidistant, you can return any one of them.
If there is no larger integer in the array relative to the number at index `i`, your function should return null.
