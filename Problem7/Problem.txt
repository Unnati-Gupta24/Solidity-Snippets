Vowel Removal
You are a programmer working on a project that requires string manipulation. 
Part of the functionality you need to implement involves removing all vowels from a given string. 
This is required for a feature that needs to generate unique identifiers from user input.

Your task is to develop a function that removes all vowels from a given string and returns the updated string.
 

Output:
removeVowels(string input) returns (string): The input can have lowercase(a - z) as well as uppercase characters(A-Z) <br>
no special characters , it shall return a string that contains the same characters as "_input" but with all vowels removed.
