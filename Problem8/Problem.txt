Cryptocurrency Round Trip
You are a cryptocurrency trader with accounts on multiple exchanges. 
The funds in each exchange are represented by the walletBalances array,
and the fees associated with transferring funds between exchanges are represented by the networkFeesarray.

Here's an example of how the process works:

You start at Exchange 0, which has a balance of $5 (walletBalances[0] = 5).
To transfer funds to Exchange 1, it costs $3 (networkFees[0] = 3).
You send the $5 to Exchange 1, and $3 is deducted as a fee.
So, the balance at Exchange 1 is increased by $2 (the $5 you transferred minus the $3 fee).

This process continues in a clockwise direction, from one exchange to the next. The goal is to 
determine if you can complete a full round and end up at the same exchange where you started while consolidating all your funds.

Return the starting exchange's index if you can complete the circuit once, consolidating all the funds into your account. 
If not possible, return -1. If a solution exists, it is guaranteed to be unique.
 

Output:
roundTrip(int[] walletBalances, int[] networkFees) returns (int): This function is given walletBalances and networkFees array as input , 
it returns the index according to the above criteria if round trip possible else returns -1.
